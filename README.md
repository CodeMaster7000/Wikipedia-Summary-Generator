# Wikipedia Summary Generator

## About
A program written in Python with Tkinter that makes it easy to access and parse data from “wikipedia.org”. 

## Function & Instructions

Wikipedia is a Python library that makes it easy to access and parse data from the search platform. Here, I have used the summary function of this module to get the summary of the argument (as a string) given to the program.

NOTE: You must have the Wikipedia module installed in order for this program to work. To do this, just type `pip install Wikipedia` in terminal.

To run the program, run `Python 3 Wikipedia Summary Generator` in a terminal if you have Python 3.
